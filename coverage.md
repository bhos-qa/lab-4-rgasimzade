# Statement, Branch, and Predicate Coverage
1. Statement Coverage
Statement coverage is one of the basic forms of code coverage. It ensures that every executable statement in the program has been executed at least once during testing. It provides a high-level view of how much of the code has been tested but does not guarantee that all logic paths have been evaluated.

2. Branch Coverage
Branch coverage goes a step further by ensuring that every possible branch (true and false outcomes of decision points) in the code has been executed. This helps in detecting issues that might be missed by just testing the statements, as it focuses on testing all the decision-making points in the code.

3. Predicate Coverage
Predicate coverage is a more in-depth testing technique that requires all the individual conditions (or predicates) within decision points to be tested. It ensures that each condition that influences the control flow of the program has been tested for both true and false outcomes, giving more granular control than branch coverage.
